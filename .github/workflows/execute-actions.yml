name: Execute Actions

# This workflow executes pending actions from daily files after PRs are merged
#
# NOTE: This is a FRAMEWORK repository. This workflow is provided as a template
# for repositories that use this framework. It is disabled here by using
# workflow_dispatch (manual trigger only).
#
# To use this in your repository:
# 1. Copy this workflow to your .github/workflows/ directory
# 2. Change the trigger from 'workflow_dispatch' to 'push' with appropriate paths
# 3. Configure any secrets needed by your action scripts
